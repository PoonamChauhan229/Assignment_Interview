Task1:

## How do you translate business requirements into technical requirements?
Ans:
Translating business requirements into technical requirements involves converting the high-level goals and needs of a business into detailed technical specifications. This process requires a deep understanding of the business objectives, prioritization of requirements, collaboration with technical experts, and the creation of functional and non-functional specifications. Clear communication and documentation are essential to ensure that the development team delivers a software solution that aligns with the business's expectations while considering technical constraints and constraints.

## How do you troubleshoot an issue?
Ans:
Troubleshooting involves systematically identifying and resolving issues. Start by understanding the problem and replicating it if possible. Investigate recent changes, review logs, and consult documentation and experts. Formulate hypotheses, test them, and document your findings. Implement fixes, verify resolution, and communicate progress to stakeholders. Finally, take preventive measures and thoroughly document the resolution for future reference.

## What would you do if you were asked to perform a task and weren't sure how to complete it?
Ans:
When faced with an unfamiliar task, I'd start by seeking clarification on its requirements, then research and learn about it, possibly reaching out for guidance. I'd break it into manageable steps, experiment where necessary, and document my progress. Maintaining persistence and reviewing the process afterward would ensure I learn from the experience and improve my problem-solving skills for future tasks.
